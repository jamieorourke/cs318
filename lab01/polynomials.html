<body> <p> If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders: </p>
    
<dl>  <dt> Constant</dt>  <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a </dd> 
   <dt> Linear </dt>  <dd> Linear polynomials have the form a &times;x + b 
  <dt>  Quadratic </dt>   <dd> Quadratic polynomials have the form a &times;
    x&sup2; + b &times;  x + c </dd>
<dt>Cubic </dt>
    <dd>Cubic polynomials have the form a &times;
        x&sup3; + b &times;
        x&sup2;  + c &times; x + d
    </dd>   </dl>
